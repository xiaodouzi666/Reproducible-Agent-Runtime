# Task 1: Activation Energy Analysis
# This task demonstrates research + computation workflow

task: "What methods are commonly used to calculate activation energy from thermal analysis data, and what are typical activation energy values for polymer decomposition?"

description: |
  This task explores the methodology for determining activation energy
  from thermal analysis experiments (TGA, DSC) and collects typical
  values from the literature for polymer decomposition processes.

seed: 42
corpus_dir: demo_data/corpus

# Expected workflow:
# 1. Planner decomposes into research + computation subtasks
# 2. Researcher searches corpus for activation energy methods
# 3. Executor runs Arrhenius calculation example
# 4. Auditor validates evidence quality
