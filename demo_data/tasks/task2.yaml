# Task 2: Thermal Stability Comparison
# This task demonstrates multi-source research workflow

task: "Compare the thermal stability and decomposition mechanisms of different polymer materials. What factors influence thermal degradation temperature?"

description: |
  This task compares thermal stability characteristics across
  different polymer materials and identifies key factors that
  affect decomposition temperature.

seed: 123
corpus_dir: demo_data/corpus

# Expected workflow:
# 1. Planner creates multiple research subtasks
# 2. Researcher searches for thermal stability data
# 3. Researcher searches for decomposition mechanisms
# 4. Auditor validates and cross-references findings
