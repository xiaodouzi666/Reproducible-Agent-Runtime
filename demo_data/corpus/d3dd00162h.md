transfer learning.14 These models and algorithms have signicantly improved prediction performance over the past few years.
However, it has been found that existing ML algorithms have
low generalization performance for test samples with diﬀerent
data distributions, and their prediction performance is oen
over-estimated due to the high dataset redundancy15 as many
