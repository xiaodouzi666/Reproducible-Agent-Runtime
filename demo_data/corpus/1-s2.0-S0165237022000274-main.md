## Methods


[1_s2_meth_01] for the calculation of non-isothermal
kinetic parameters can be divided into fitted model methods and iso­
conversional methods, each of which has its drawbacks and are used in a
complementary way [15]. Isoconversional methods allow evaluating the
evolution of the effective kinetic energy of the reaction without
assuming a reaction model, which indicates a dependence on the degree
of conversion that indirectly reflects the complexity of the reactions and
mechanisms of the thermochemical treatments of biomass. There are
numerous isoconversional kinetic methods including the Friedman dif­
ferential method, the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (FWO) integral method, the
Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) integral method, or the Vyazovkin
nonlinear integral method [16,17].
Another aspect to consider in thermochemical treatments is the
conversion of biomass to chemical products and fuels. Pyrolysis pro­
duces a mixture of gas, bio-oil, and char, which also is the initial step in
gasification, therefore analyzing these products is critical for under­
standing the quality of the raw materials. Thermal desorption/gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD/GC-MS) is a technique that
allows the analysis of small samples of volatile compounds and has been
successfully applied to the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Although
this method is very useful, it has the disadvantage of
