## Abstract


[s10973_024_13630_6_abs_01] Potential interactions during thermal degradation of polymer blends significantly influence product yields and their composition. Therefore, chemical recycling of plastic waste requires fundamental understanding of feedstock dependency for effective
process design. This study investigates the pyrolysis of polymer blends (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, ABS, PET, PA6, PVC) through
thermogravimetric experiments at different heating rates. Sample homogeneity’s impact on interactions is analyzed using
particles, powder, coextruded blends, and samples in crucibles with separated compartments. A kinetic model is presented
to support the experimental findings, assuming linear superposition of individual polymer kinetics. A proposed grouping
of thermoplastics, reflecting their degradation behavior and potential interactions, correlates with the polymer structure.
Observed interactions, particularly in blends of heteroatom-containing polymers (N, O, Cl), are accelerated reactions and
coke formation. Hence, the model accurately predicts the degradation of heteroatom-free polymer mixtures but encounters
challenges with more complex blends. This comprehensive study emphasizes the importance of feedstock composition for
future pyrolytic polymer recycling.
