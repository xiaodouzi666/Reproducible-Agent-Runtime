## Abstract


[polymers_11_00281_v2_abs_01] : This work presents an in-depth kinetic study of the thermal degradation of recycled
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
data in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates comprised between 2 and 30 K min−1 were
used to obtain the apparent activation energy (Ea ) of the thermal degradation process of ABS
by isoconversional (differential and integral) model-free methods. Among others, the differential
Friedman method was used. Regarding integral methods, several methods with different
approximations of the temperature integral were used, which gave different accuracies in Ea .
In particular, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and the Starink
methods were used. The
